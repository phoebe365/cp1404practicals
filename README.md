# CP1404 Practicals Repository 

Hello, my name is Phoebe. I'm a Data Science student at JCU, learning python programming for the first time. 
This repository contains my practical work for the [CP1404](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals) course. This course provides 
[pattern guides](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns) that are extremely helpful for creating efficient and readable code. 

## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code 
- Good Variable Names: Giving variables and functions clear, descriptive names is crucial for code readability. Avoiding vague names like `x` or `num` helps make code self-documenting and easier to understand.
- Consistent Formatting: Proper indentation and consistent use of spaces make code easier to read. Adhering to standard style guides such as PEP 8 helps maintain uniformity. 
- Avoiding Duplication: Repeating code is oft  en a sign that a function or block of code can be refactored. Using functions and classes to abstract repeated logic not only makes the code shorter but also easier to maintain and test.
