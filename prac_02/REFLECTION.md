# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
90%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Wednesdays: 2-5pm at JCU

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been doing the "Do Now" segments in the lectures, which have helped me become more 
comfortable with python as it is my first time using it. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Paying more attention in the lectures, I often learn the content during the workshops as its
easier to pick up programming by just doing it. But understanding the conventions the first time 
will make me more efficient and a better programmer. 

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I often find myself having to go back to the lecture notes, or ask peers if they are having 
similar problems, rather than learning the content and being able to "play around" with my program 
until it works. 

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Reading through the instructions all the way through first before doing the problems
makes it far easier to complete the prac and understand the code.
