# CP1404 Practical Reflection
## Estimates
Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates where normally within a 20min range, close but often times I found I took longer than expected. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My accuracy improved as I began to understand how long certain topics and practicals would take me. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt that I often don't allocate sufficient time to the tasks and have since given myself more time to complete everything. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learnt that I often don't look at my formatting, and that some of the approaches I take a longer than what they should be. 
For example, in Prac 8 I got the feedback "Did you notice you seem to be repeating yourself with this code self.root.ids.user_input.text? 
You either get it from the kivy file (self.text) or in the main program. Did you consider using some form of get_valid_number where it gets the input from 'self.root.ids.user_input.text' 
once and validates it? Or maybe you could add that in your convert_to_float function somehow? This does not mean what you have done is wrong just something to consider" from @Jordan-Whiteside. 
I found this extremely helpful, and it inspired me to think of multiple ways to complete something before just jumping straight into the problem. I also learnt that I need to become better at cleaning my code 
I often would forget to delete unnecessary lines or leave big gaps of space between functions. 

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learnt that going through other peoples good can provide a great perspective on how many different approaches you can take for one problem. 
I loved seeing how different everyone thinks and I believe there is a lot of value in that. Also, people tend to miss smaller issues in their own code, which can be easily caught by a second person. 

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 9 Review](https://github.com/scott-gills-dyer/cp1404practicals/pull/6)

### Explanation
In this review, I took my time to consider every variable names importance and meaning to provide good name feedback. 
When I did find an issue in the code I used a constructive and supportive tone to explain the problem and provided them with the prompt from the task 
so they could see the issue. I also gave compliments on approaches I didn't think of or things that were done efficiently. 


### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 6 Review](https://github.com/taitymrobinson/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation
In this review, I gave positive feedback when specific requirements in this subject were met. These included good naming, using constant variables, and methods that where efficient. 
I also gave constructive feedback on an approach that didn't practice an if,else loop layout. Overall, I tried to match aspects in the code to the subject's content and then provide feedback. 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of the subject, I would probably add a little more guidance on where to start the practicals. I think the hardest part is knowing what to do first, which could discourage students who think the subject is too hard for them. 
Also, maybe providing solutions that show multiple ways to do something could harbour a more creative environment. Overall, I found that the tasks where challenging and engaging, which made completing them very rewarding. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I managed to complete all my practicals which I was proud of. Some of the bigger tasks in the practicals I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do.
Also, I watched the lectures and made sure I was up to date with the content before attempting the practicals, I found this made me consolidate my learning and I had a better reference as to where to start and 
what was expected.
